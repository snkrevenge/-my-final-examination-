Git is a distributed version control system, as a contrast to for example subversion that is centralized. What this means is that with subversion, the code repository (repo) lives on a server and people need special permissions (commit rights) to be able to add code to the repo. Everything lives in one place.
GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers. ... GitHub can be thought of as a serious social networking site for software developers. Members can follow each other, rate each other's work, receive updates for specific projects and communicate publicly or privately.
